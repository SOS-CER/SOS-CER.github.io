# Team GitHub Repository

Each team has been assigned a [GitHub Repository]({{site.data.comprehensive-exercise.github}}) for the Comprehensive Exercise. Everything for the exercise will be submitted via GitHub. The repositories are named `csc116-AAA-CE-BB`, where `AAA` is your section number and `BB` is your team number.

You should refer to the [Git Guide]({{site.data.comprehensive-exercise.git-guide}}) for the use of GitHub.

At a **minimum**, you should push your work to GitHub at the end of each class period (though you should be pushing *much* more frequently -- as a rule of thumb, you should only push code that compiles successfully).

## Submitting Comprehensive Exercise

You will submit the final version of your comprehensive exercise via GitHub. You should push all code, report (pdf), and slides (pptx or pdf) to GitHub prior to the submission deadline. Note that you will *not* be able to submit after the deadline as the GitHub repo permissions will be changed to read only.

You will have a link to your [report](./team-documentation) within team repo's README.md. You will share your planning document with the teaching staff via Google Drive. For the final version of your report, you will submit a PDF of the report.

Push your `CE` project directory:

```
CE
    -> src 
        -> (source code)
    -> test
        -> (JUnit tests)
    -> lib 
        -> junit-4.12.jar
        -> hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
    -> bin
    -> doc
        -> (javadoc for all of src directory)
    -> project_docs
        -> (Team report)
        -> (Slides - pptx or pdf)
    -> test-files
        -> (Any test files that are needed)
```
