# Wheel of Fortune

I would like the application to support three rounds in a single game (a new puzzle for each round). The player with the lowest score in a round will begin as the first player in the next round. If multiple players have the same lowest score, then the player with the lowest score whose name appears first alphabetically should begin the next round. Each round has a category and a blank puzzle phrase (associated with the category).

When a player successfully solves the puzzle, the round ends, and that player’s round score is added to his/her total game score.  The other players do not accumulate any money to their total game score in this round.

At the end of the game, the player with the highest game score will be declared the winner. After each round, the current game score for each player should be displayed. Each player’s round score should be displayed each time they are given a choice of action (spin, buy, solve).

In addition, when prompting the player for their next option, the application should also display the "used letter" information (in other words, display all of the letters that have already been guessed during the current round).
