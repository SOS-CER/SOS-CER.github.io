# Project Selection

Each team will select a client project ideas to work on.

* **Bunco:** Create an application of the game Bunco---a family-friendly dice game that requires no skill and is all luck.
* **Connect Four:** Create an application of the game Connect Four.
* **Wheel of Fortune:** Create an application for a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune.

Once you have selected your client idea, let your instructor know, and you will be given the full client idea.
