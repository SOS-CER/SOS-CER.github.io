# Presentation

On Day 4, you will present your completed exercise to the class. Each group will have ten minutes to present their work; minimum length of group presentation is seven minutes. Each student must present for at least two minutes of the presentation.

For the presentation, you should have slides that describe the basics of what the software does (requirements/analysis phase), the basics of your groups’ design options and decisions (design phase), and the basics of the testing of your software. You should also complete a live demo of your software.

You are expected to attend all presentations for your given section. During presentations, your computer monitor should be turned off and you should not be using your phone, tablet, etc. Along with being a respectful audience member, you will provide a peer review to each fellow group about their presentation.
