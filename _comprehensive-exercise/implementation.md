# Implementation
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation" %}

The _implementation phase_ is the "period of time in the software life cycle during which a software product is created from design documentation and debugged" [1].


## TASK: Implementation
{% include iconHeader.html type="teamTask" %}

During this phase of the process, you will begin to write code for the software you designed in the previous step. As you write code, remember to include proper documentation.

In the journal section of the [comprehensive exercise report](./team-documentation), identify a list of programming concepts you will need to implement your design and how they will be applied. In the formal documentation of Implementation, you should include a README for the user that explains how they will interact with the system.

Note: You should work on the implementation and [testing](./testing) concurrently.

## TASK: Reflection
{% include iconHeader.html type="individualTask" %}

Once you have completed the implementation AND testing tasks, each student should individually complete the reflection on [implementation and testing]({{site.data.comprehensive-exercise.imp-test-reflection}}).
