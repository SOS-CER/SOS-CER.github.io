# Comprehensive Exercise Description

You will spend the next four class periods working with your group to apply the concepts that you have learned this semester in {{site.data.comprehensive-exercise.course-short}} from requirements and design to implementation and testing. On the final day, you will be presenting your work to the class. Your client (your instructor) expects your work to be well planned, implemented, tested, and presented. Recall from the syllabus that this exercise and your presentation are worth 2% of your semester grade, which can easily determine your letter grade (+ or -).

Collaboration between students who are not in the same group is forbidden for this exercise.  Your group is responsible for keeping its documents and code hidden from all other students.

## Attendance Requirement

Since attendance in CSC116 is required, you are expected to attend all four days of class to work with your team and present your work.

- Students who do not attend Day 1 will receive a 33% deduction in their Comprehensive Exercise grade.
- Students who do not attend Day 2 will receive a 33% deduction in their Comprehensive Exercise grade.
- Students who do not attend Day 3 will receive a 33% deduction in their Comprehensive Exercise grade.
- Students who do not attend Day 4 to present and demo their work with their team will receive a 0 for the Comprehensive Exercise.

## Team Formation

Each team will be assigned by your instructor.

You will also complete peer evaluations for your teammates and yourself.
