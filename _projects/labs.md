# CS2 Guided Projects & Labs

Students in CSC 216 - Programming Concepts in Java at NC State University complete three Guided Projects and 12 labs over the course of the semester.  These labs build into a course registration system that is almost 10,000 lines of source and test code.  The Guided Projects and Labs are provided below; however, the teaching staff tests are only available upon request to faculty interested in looking at the full labs.  Contact sarah_heckman @ ncsu.edu for more details or with any questions.

## Guided Projects

Guided Projects introduce students to course technologies while reviewing prereq materials from a CS1 course. Students are creating a personal course planning tool called [WolfScheduler](wolf-scheduler/).

  * [Guided Project 1](gp1/index.html): Focuses on object-oriented composition and introduces students to Eclipse, GitHub, and Jenkins.
  * [Guided Project 2](gp2/index.html): Focuses on inheritance.
  * [Guided Project 3](gp3/index.html): Focuses on unit and system testing.

## Labs

The lab assignments build throughout the semester and incorporate some [WolfScheduler](wolf-scheduler/) functionality to create the PackSchduler course registration system.
