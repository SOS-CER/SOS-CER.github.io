# Remote Repositories
In order to collaborate on projects as a team, you need to know how to interact with remote repositories we provide for you on [NCSU GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu).

Since you [cloned your remote NCSU GitHub repository](git-clone), Git already knows where that remote repository is located. 

You will interact with your NCSU GitHub repository in two main ways:

   * [Pushing your local repository commit snapshots](git-push) to your NCSU GitHub repository.
   * [Pulling your remote NCSU Repository contents](git-pull) to your local repository.
