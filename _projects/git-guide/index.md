# Git Guide
Git is supported on the NCSU campus by [NCSU GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu). As a student, you will work in Eclipse, commit your code to your local repository (on your own computer), and push your code from your local repository to your NCSU-hosted remote repository on NCSU GitHub. The teaching staff will grade your code that is on remote repository by running it through tests that reside in the teaching staff repositories.

There are two main ways to interact with Git locally:

   1. with the Eclipse EGit plug-in, or
   2. with a git client for your operating system. 

Each section below will approach the topic from both the Eclipse Egit plug-in and git bash perspective.  The last two sections provide an example workflow with each tool.  A third way is to use a [Git GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) tool; however, this guide will only discuss the EGit plug-in and command line git bash client.
