# Loading a Project in Eclipse
Once Eclipse knows where your repository is located, you can begin working on your coding projects.

To begin working on a project, you have a few options:

   * You have an existing Eclipse project in Package Explorer that you would like to [share to your repository](git-share).
   * You have an existing Eclipse project in your repository that you would like to [import and work on locally](git-import).
