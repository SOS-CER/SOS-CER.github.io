# Importing an Existing Project from your Repository
This section describes what to do if your NCSU GitHub already contains an Eclipse project that you have been working on, but you do not currently have a copy of the project in your Eclipse workspace. 

   1. In the **Git Repositories** window, expand the **Working Directory** folder, right-click the project you want to import into Eclipse, and choose **Import Projects**. 
   
{% include image.html file="images/14_clone_import.png" caption="Figure: Importing an Existing Project from your Repository" %} 
	 
   {:start="2"}  
   2. In the **Import** window that opens, make sure the correct project is selected, then click **Next**.
	 
{% include image.html file="images/importExistingProject.png" caption="Figure: Importing an Existing Project from your Repository" %}      
	
   {:start="3"}
   3. Click **Finish**.
	 
{% include image.html file="images/importExistingProject2.png" caption="Figure: Importing an Existing Project from your Repository" %} 

   Your project should now be available in Package Explorer so that you can continue coding. 	 
   
{% include image.html file="images/packageExplorer.png" caption="Figure: Your Project in Package Explorer" %}
