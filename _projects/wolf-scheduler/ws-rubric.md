# Rubrics
We will use the following rubrics to evaluate your Guided Projects.  The rubrics will vary by Guided Project depending on the focus of the Guided Project's learning outcomes.  


## Guided Project 1 Rubric
Your Wolf Scheduler Guided Project 1 will be evaluated on the following items:

**Overall Rubric**

|Phase|Grade Item|Points|Details|
|------|:----------|------:|:----------------------------------------------|
|{% include icon.html type="design" width="30px" %}{% include icon.html type="unitTest" width="30px" %}|Teaching Staff JUnit Tests|40|Pass all of the provided JUnit tests.|
|{% include icon.html type="systemTest" width="30px" %}|Teaching Staff Black Box Tests|40|There are 13 test cases at 2 points a piece. To pass a test case, your program must show the appropriate actual results for the provided test inputs. An additional 1 point per test is for reporting the actual results of your program in the black box test plan - even if the test is failing.|
|{% include icon.html type="implementation" width="30px" %}|Javadoc contents|10|See the Javadoc rubric, below. The rubric will be applied per class and will be averaged by the number of classes (in this project, 3).|
|{% include icon.html type="implementation" width="30px" %}|Javadoc generation|5|Javadoc tool was used to generate the HTML version of the API, which matches the current version of the in-code Javadoc.|
{% include icon.html type="implementation" width="30px" %}|Style|5|Any PMD, CheckStyle, or FindBugs Scary or Scariest notifications will result in a one point deduction, up to the available points.|
| |Deductions|varies|See possible deductions below.|
| |Total|100| |

**Deductions**

|Deduction Item|Deduction|Details|
|:--------------|---------:|----------------------------------------|
|Misnamed submission file|-5|Your entire Eclipse project, named `WolfScheduler`, must be pushed to GitHub for automated grading.  If your Jenkins job cannot find and grade your project, the teaching staff will attempt to grade it manually.  The deduction will apply in this case.|
|Incomplete project submission|-5|If the teaching staff are unable to directly import your submission as an Eclipse project into our workspaces when grading, you will receive a 5 point deduction. Make sure that your `.project` and `.classpath` files are pushed to GitHub.|
|Late|varies|You will lose 1 point for every 2 hours your project is late, up to 24 points.|

**Javadoc Rubric (per class)**

|Item|3 points - Strong|2 points - Adequate|1 point - Inadequate|
|----|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|Class comments|Class comments fully describe the behavior and abstraction of the class. Author tag is there.|Class comments lack some details of the class' behavior and abstraction. Author tag may be missing.|Class comments are there but provide no detail about the class' purpose. Author tag may be missing.|
|Method comments|Method comments fully describe the behavior of the method. Param and return tags are there and fully specified as appropriate for the method.|Method comments lack some details about the method's behavior.  Param and return tags are there, but not fully specified.|Method comments are there but provide no detail about the method's purpose. Param and return tags are missing.|
|Field comments|Field comments fully describe the field's state as part of the class' abstraction|Field comments lack some details about the field's state as part of the class.|Field comments are minimal and provide no detail about the field's purpose.|
|Spelling|No spelling errors|A few minor spelling errors that do not distract from the content.|Many spelling errors that distract from the content|
|Grammar|No grammatical errors|A few grammatical errors that do not distract from the content|Many grammatical errors that distract from the content.|

Each class will be evaluated using the above rubric. The score for each class will be combined to generated the earned the points for Javadoc contents and then scaled to fit the rubric value.
