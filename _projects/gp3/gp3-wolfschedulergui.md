# Independent Task: Update `WolfSchedulerGUI`
Black box test the `WolfScheduler` system to ensure that the conflict functionality is working correctly from end-to-end.

  * Run (and revise) black box tests

## `WolfSchedulerGUI`
`WolfSchedulerGUI` did not require any changes from GP2.  But if you need a new copy, [copy the code from `WolfSchedulerGUI.java`](../gp2/files/WolfSchedulerGUI.java) into your Eclipse file.  Overwrite the entirety of the old file.

## Run Tests
Run your tests!  If any are still failing, use the debugger to help you find the problem.  Report the actual results of your tests.

If you need to revise your tests to more correctly describe the inputs or outputs, you may do so.

## Push to GitHub
Use the feedback from Jenkins to make changes to your code.  Any time you make a change, push to GitHub and check the Jenkins results.

  * Ensure tests are passing, Javadoc is generated, and all static analysis notifications are removed.
  * Add the unstaged changes to the index.
  * Commit and push changes.  Remember to use a meaningful commit message describing how you have changed the code.  Try writing your own commit message for this push!
