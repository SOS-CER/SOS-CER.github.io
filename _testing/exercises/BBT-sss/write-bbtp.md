## Writing Black Box Tests

Create at least 10 black-box test cases for the Somewhat Simplified Solitaire software. Your test cases must be non-redundant, repeatable, and specific! *Non-redundant* means that each test case should correspond to a unique error condition or a unique combination of valid inputs.  Remember to test against the requirements, incorporate equivalence classes, and incorporate boundary testing. Beneath your Test ID, indicate which strategy you used when developing the test case (*R* for requirements, *EC* for equivalence classes, *BV* for boundary testing). For the black box test plan, you should not look at the code.[^class] Instead your tests should only be based on the [requirements](index#requirements) given.

## Footnote
[^class]: We are intentionally providing you with a compiled version of the program so that you do not look at the code.
