# Submitting Testing Exercises
{% include iconHeader.html type="deployment" %}

You should download a PDF version of your BBTP and place it in your `project_docs` directory. Then push your repo to GitHub.

## Expected Repo Structure[^gi]

```
- Repo (e.g., csc116-001-LabX-Y)
- - README.md
- - SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaire
- - - src (empty and will not show on website)
- - - bin 
- - - - SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaire.class
- - - doc (empty and will not show on website)
- - - test (empty and will not show on website)
- - - lib (empty and will not show on website)
- - - project_docs
- - - - BlackBoxTestPlan_SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaire.pdf
```
## Footnotes
[^gi]: Since you only have the .class file and not .java file, we are not going to include the .gitignore so that the .class file will be committed and pushed to the remote repo.
