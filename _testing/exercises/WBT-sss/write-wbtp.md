# Create White-Box Test Cases
{% include iconHeader.html type="unitTest" %}


1. Within the given `SomewhatSimplifiedSolitaireTest.java`, create at least two test cases for each of the public methods in SomewhatSimplifiedSolitaire.java. Your test cases must be non­redundant, repeatable, and specific! Non­redundant means that each test case should correspond to a unique error condition or a unique combination of valid inputs. Be sure to consider:
    - paths through the code
    - equivalence classes
    - boundary values
2. Compile and execute your `SomewhatSimplifiedSolitaireTest.java`. Some of the test cases may fail!
