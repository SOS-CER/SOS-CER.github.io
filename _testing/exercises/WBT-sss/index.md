# White Box Testing Lab Exercises

The CSC116 Software Testing materials can be found [here](../..). For the testing lab, you will be testing a program that classifies triangles based on sides and angles.

{% capture callout_content %}
  * Describe the purpose of testing.
  * Describe the testing process.
  * Describe how black box and white box testing differ and why each are necessary.
  * Describe the purpose of black box testing.
  * Write black box test cases in table form (Black Box Test Plan) based on program requirements.
  * Write black box test cases using equivalence classes and boundary value analysis.
  * Draw a control flow diagram for given code.
Calculate the cyclomatic complexity of given code.
  * List valid path through given code using control flow diagram.
  * Write white box test cases using basis paths, equivalence classes, and boundary value analysis
  * Describe the purpose of debugging.
  * Apply debugging techniques.

## Requirements
{% include iconHeader.html type="requirements" %}

The `SomewhatSimplifiedSolitaire` program can be used to encrypt messages. The program should prompt the user for a starting deck (of 26 cards), whether encrypting or decrypting, and the message to encrypt or decrypt.

For a full description of the program and algorithm, please see the [Somewhat Simplified Solitaire reference page](../../../sssolitaire)

## Implementation
{% include iconHeader.html type="implementation" %}

You will be testing the given [Somewhat Simplified Solitaire implementation](../../../sssolitaire/assets/SomewhatSimplifiedSolitaire.java).
