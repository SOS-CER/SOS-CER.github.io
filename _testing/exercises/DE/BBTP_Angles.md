## Writing Black Box Tests

Given the Black Box Test Plan, you should add at least 5 more black box test cases for ***angles***. Your test cases must be non-redundant, repeatable, and specific! *Non-redundant* means that each test case should correspond to a unique error condition or a unique combination of valid inputs. Be sure to consider equivalence classes and boundary values when designing your test cases. Remember: For the black box test plan, you should not look at the code. Instead your tests should only be based on the requirements given above.

Your Black Box Test Plan should contain the results of running your test cases on the TriangleClassification. Note that if the expected and actual results are not the same, there is a bug in the code. You should not correct the bug at this point.
