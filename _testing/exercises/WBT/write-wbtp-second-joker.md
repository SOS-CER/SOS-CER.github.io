# Create White-Box Test Cases for `moveSecondJokerDownTwo`
{% include iconHeader.html type="unitTest" %}


1. Within the given `SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaireTest.java`, add test cases for `moveSecondJokerDownTwo` based on the different input from the [control flow diagram](control-flow). If the complexity of your diagram was 10, you should add 10 test cases based on the different input values from all of the paths.
2. Compile and execute your `SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaireTest.java`. Some of the test cases may fail! 

## Hints for Creating White-Box Test Cases

- The control flow diagram and looking at the paths through your code can help you come up with different test cases.
- The `moveSecondJokerDownTwo` method relates to a single step of the algorithm. Look back at your notes from BBT to help you come up with test cases that test equivalence classes and boundary values.
