# Draw Control-Flow Diagrams
{% include iconHeader.html type="unitTest" %}

<!---
1. Draw a control-flow diagram[^drawio] for each of the following methods:
    - `moveFirstJokerDownOne`
    - `moveSecondJokerDownTwo`
2. Using your calculated values for cyclomatic complexity, identify values for the method parameters that will cover all the possible paths through the method. For example, if your cyclomatic complexity is 5, you should identify 5 sets of input values that will execute the 5 different paths through the method.
3. Save your control-flow diagrams (as PNG or JPEG) in your Solitaire/project_docs folder.

## Hints

- You can label your diamonds and rectangles with line numbers instead of copying code into the diagram.
- The sets of input values will be helpful for the next step and will easily become test cases.

## Footnote
[^drawio]: We suggest using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) for your diagrams.
