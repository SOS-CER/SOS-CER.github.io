# Debug `SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaire` for `moveSecondJokerDownTwo`

Using the failed test cases from white-box testing, you will debug your code (find and fix errors/bugs).

As you debug, keep track of all the bugs you find and fix. Document each of the bugs in your README.java file. For each bug, indicate whether you discovered the bug through ***white-box testing***.

1. Debug `SomewhatMoreSimplifiedSolitaire.java` until all of your current white-box test cases pass. **DO NOT CHANGE YOUR TEST CASES unless you are 100% sure that you specified the wrong/incorrect expected results.** 
2. Each time you change the source code, re-run your JUnit test cases to make sure you do not accidentally cause any of your white-box tests to fail.
