# Summary

Testing is an important part of the software development process and
helps increase our confidence that our software meets the requirements
set out by the customer (or your instructor). Systematic application of
the strategies presented in this document will help you create a suite
of test cases that will efficiently test your code. Black box testing is
used to test the program as a whole by specifying program inputs and
checking the generated outputs with the expected values. Black box
testing should be completed along with white box testing. White box
testing uses the source code to guide the development of test cases.
Writing test cases for each method is a specific type of white box
testing called unit testing. White box test cases can be written in
another Java program, which allows for the automation of your testing
efforts. Overall, testing is a technique that identifies underlying
program faults by exercising the program you have developed.
