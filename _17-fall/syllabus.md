## Course Structure
CSC326 meets for two [75-minute lectures](#lectures) and one [110-minute laboratory](#lab) each week.  Final course grades are a combination of [on-boarding workshops](#on-boarding-workshops), a four-week [guided project](#guided-project), a six-week [team project](#team-project), a [midterm exam](#exams), and a [final exam](#exams).  Final grades will be adjusted based on [attendance and participation](#attendance-and-participation) in both [lecture](#lecture) and [lab](#lab) due to the amount of [time](#time) that you are expected to contribute to the course as part of the teaming experience.

### Grading

Final grades will be adjusted based on [attendance and participation](#attendance-and-participation) in both [lecture](#lecture) and [lab](#lab) due to the amount of [time](#time) that you are expected to contribute to the course as part of the teaming experience.

This course uses Standard NCSU Letter Grading: A+ (97-100), A (93-96), A-(90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-(70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-(60-62), F (below 60).

#### Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading
In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams and complete all assignments earning a grade of C- or better.  Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) is subject to university deadlines.  Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading.  For more details refer to http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15.

#### Requirements for Auditors (AU)
Information about and requirements for auditing a course can be found at http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-04.

The grade of "AU" will be awarded to students who take all exams and earn a 60% or higher on both.  Auditors are required to meet with the instructor during the first two weeks of the course.

### On-Boarding Workshops
The first 2.5 weeks of the course (both lectures and labs) will involve a series of training workshops that will introduce you to the technologies that you will be using to complete coursework on the larger course projects. You will complete the on-boarding workshops on a small team.

### Guided Project
Leading up to the [Team Project](#team-project), you will have a four-week guided project that will walk you through developing a use case of functionality for the course project, iTrust2.  The Guided Project will focus on the application of software engineering processes to solve technical problems using the technologies introduced during on-boarding.  You will complete the Guided Project on a small team.

### Team Project
CSC326 culminates in a six-week team project completed on a team of four or five students.  During the project teams will complete some required functionality and select optional pieces to customize their version of iTrust2.  The team project will be as real-world as we can make it, which might just mean that some aspects of the project may intentionally cause you some heartache (such as ill-defined and/or changing requirements).

During the team project, each team member will take on a leadership role for some aspect of the project development.  However, all team members are also developers.  As such, we expect that teach team member will contribute to the team's project by pushing a meaningful code change to the team's GitHub repo that is merged to production for each iteration.  The team project details will describe how participation, contribution, and following process will be assessed.

Additionally, we expect that 1) the master branch will stay green; 2) that there will always be a deployed iTrust on your team's executor, and 3) there is at least one merge of the development branch to master for each iteration.

### Exams
The midterm and final exam cover 30% of your final grade and assess individual knowledge about software engineering topics.  **Any** unexcused absence from the midterm or final exm will result in a grade of 0 for the exam.

The final exam is cumulative.

No late entry to the exam period will be allowed after the first 30 minutes or after the first person leaves the exam, whichever comes first.  **Please be on time.  Note that the final exam starts at 8am!**

### Attendance and Participation
Software Engineering may be considered an introduction to the profession.  This class should be treated as a job.  If you fail to show up to lecture or lab, you not only hurt yourself, but also your team.  Success in CSC326 depends on making a commitment to attend all the lectures and labs and contributing to all class activities.  

Experience has shown that attendance is extremely important - both in lecture AND lab - for your success in CSC326.  Lectures will incorporate workshops and materials that are important to know before labs.  The following attendance policy reflects this importance.

Please email the instructor for any absence, just like you would let your manager know if you needed to miss work.  Documentation of an absence is required to excuse the absence.  Please discuss documentation requirements with the instructor on a case by case basis.  Undocumented absences will be considered unexcused. Communication is key if you're going to miss lecture or lab.  Let your instructors, TAs, and team know ahead of time.  The teaching staff understands that life happens.  Please communicate as promptly as possible to ensure the best outcomes for you and your team.

#### Lecture
Lecture type will vary based on the topic covered.  Some lectures will be workshops, others will incorporate active learning exercises.  You will sit with your team and lab during lecture since many activities will support teaming and assignments.  

Because you will be expected to work with your team attendance will be taken.

  * If you miss **three unexcused** lectures, you will lose **3 points** off your final grade.  Any additional unexcused absences after three will result in **1 additional point** of your final grade for every absence.  **Ten unexcused absences** (one-third of lectures) and you will **fail** the course. 
  * If you are absent from lecture, with an excused absence, you will not be penalized for missing any activities associated with the class.  You will be expected to work with your team toward any course deliverable.

#### Lab
Students must allow at least 15-30 minutes to read the lab assignment and complete a pre-lab (if required) before arriving at the lab. Attendance will be taken.  **All students are required to stay the entire lab period.**  Labs will consist of either interactive workshops or will be time when you can work with your team to complete course deliverables.  Co-located teams are more productive, so the expectation is that you will take advantage of the time to work together using good software engineering processes.

  * If you miss **one unexcused** lab, you will lose **5 points** off your final grade; miss **two unexcused** labs and you will lose **10 points** (one full letter grade); miss **three or more unexcused labs** and you will **fail** the course.
  * If you miss more than **20 minutes of lab** without a documented excuse, you will lose **0.5 point** off your final grade.
  * If you fail to complete any **pre- or post-lab assignments** for a given lab (if there are any), you will lose **0.5 point** of your final grade.
  * If you are absent from lab, with an excused absence, email the instructor to discuss how the absence should be handled.
  
### Time
CSC326 will require work outside of the four hours you spend in lecture and lab.  The amount of time that you personally will spend on the course depends on many factors, some out of the teaching staff's control.  Our goal is for you to spend **10-12 hours per week on CSC326 work**, but some weeks may require more depending on you and your team's requirements, design, implementation, and tests and how well your team follows software engineering processes and practices. 

## Course Policies

### Hardware / Software Support
The course programs will be completed using a variety of technologies that build on those that you used in your earlier coursework.  On-boarding workshops will introduce you to the new technologies that will be used for development and automated testing.  However, there is an expectation that you may need to explore the technologies on your own, beyond the on-boarding workshops to successfully complete course deliverables.  Technologies may change over the course of the semester depending on the direction of the project (where possible, we like to provide the opportunity to explore integrating something new into the course project).

All course projects will be completed in the open-source Eclipse development environment.  The development environment is available for use in the EBII Collaborative System Development / Multimedia Lab (EBII 1221) and are either freely available or have an educational license for download for use on personal computers.

All on-boarding, guided project, and project work will be submitted through NC State's GitHub (http://github.ncsu.edu).  You will be assigned repositories for your use during CSC326.  The last submission before the assignment deadline will be graded for product points, but submission history and other project artifacts (issue tracker, wiki, documentation) will be considered to evaluate process, contribution, and other assessable project components.

A continuous integration server, Jenkins, will be used to automatically build, test, and (during the team project) deploy your course project.  Product points (passing tests, coverage, etc.) will be pulled from Jenkins.

### Computers and Electronic Devices
Students are encouraged to use computers and other electronic devices like tablets during lecture and lab.  The teaching staff asks that students respect their neighbors and keep their focus on course materials rather than on games, social media, etc.  Electronic devices are required for submission of coursework and other course deliverables.  Students who cause distractions due to inappropriate use of electronic devices may have grade penalties applied at the discretion of the instructor.

**You may not record the lecture or labs without express written permission of the instructor and/or TA.**

### Professionalism
Students are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful and professional manner at all times.  Students are expected to act professionally both in person and electronically with all members of the teaching staff and their classmates.  Communication, both written and verbal, should be respectful and should never include derogatory comments about yourself or others.  All criticism (of yourself, the course, instructor, TAs, fellow students, resources, etc.) should be constructive and provide feedback for improvement.  Guidelines for [electronic communication](#electronic-communication) are listed in the section below.

Professionalism also includes [attendance and participation](#attendance-and-participation).  If you are unable to participate, please notify the teaching staff and your team as soon as possible.  If you have a missing teammate, please notify the teaching staff as soon as possible.

Report any unprofessional behavior by an class member (including the TAs) to the instructor. 

Unprofessional electronic communication on course forums may result in suspension from the course forum and possible grade penalties.  Unprofessional in-person behavior, including a lack of participation, will result in a conference with the instructor and possible grade adjustments for all involved parties.

### Electronic Communication 
The class will use Piazza for message board communications, which is linked in on the course website.

The teaching staff looks forward to receiving emails and message board posts about any questions that you have about the class, materials, projects, exams, and grades.  Since software engineering is the introduction to the profession, we expect that all communication will be professional and reflect professional communication practices.  The teaching staff receive *many* emails on a daily basis and the instructor teaches several courses.  By following the guidelines below, the teaching staff will be better able to answer your questions or address your concerns.  

As a teaching staff, our goal is to answer all emails and message board posts within 24 hours on a weekday and within 48 hours on a weekend or holiday.  Most of the time, we will respond more quickly, but that is not guaranteed due to other responsibilities and classes.

  * **Before sending an email**, try to find the answer to your question by using various references already available to you:
     * If the question is related to class administration, check the syllabus.
     * If the question is related to recent information, check previous emails from the teaching staff, which will also be archived on Moodle.
     * If the question is assignment or exam related, check the message board to see if it has already been answered.
     * If the question is material related, check the lecture notes and textbook.
  * For emails, please identify your course, lab section, and your name (first and last name) in the subject line along with the subject of the message.  For example: "CSC326-201 Jenny Smith - Question about Guided Project Part 2".  
  * For absences, please email your instructor and cc your lab TA.  Please identify your course, lab section, and your name (first and last name) in the subject line along with Absence and the date(s). For example: "CSC326-201 Jenny Smith - Absence on 9/1/2017".
  * Emails should include a salutation to indicate the recipients of the email and who need to act on the contents.  For example, "Dr. Heckman" or "Teaching Staff".
  * Keep the tone professional.  Re-read your email before you press send and make a judgment as to how you would respond if you were a recipient of the email.
  * If you have a question that is beyond the scope of an email, consider coming to office hours or scheduling an appointment.
  * If you have several questions, please number them for ease of reading and responding.
  * Please spell check and correct mechanical/grammar errors.
  * Avoid emails written only in lowercase and lacking punctuation.
  * Close your emails with your name.
  * Please use reply all when responding to an email that includes the teaching staff or the teaching staff mailing list.  
  
If you have a general question about a project, post your question to Piazza as an open question.  One of your classmates may be able to help and we encourage you to help answer others questions!  If you have a question that involves snippets of code or something personal, post a private Piazza question or email the teaching staff mailing list. TODO - insert mailing list address here.

### Grade Appeals
If at any time you feel an assignment was graded improperly, **submit your appeal through the Grade Appeals form linked in on the course website.  All regrade requests must be submitted to the teaching staff via the Grade Appeals form no later than 1 week after the assignment was returned to you or for assignments returned within one week of the final, before the final exam time.**

### Late Assignments
The late window for each assignment, if any, will be posted in the assignment write-up.  Some assignments may not have late windows.  Assignments submitted during the late window will receive a penalty as listed on the assignment rubric.  No submissions will be accepted beyond the late window without a university excused absence, and any extensions must be arranged with the teaching staff.  Remember that the assignments are all completed on teams, so extensions are non-trivial to work out.  

No late submissions will be accepted through email.

### Attendance Policy 
For complete attendance and excused absence policies, please see http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03 for university policies and (Attendance and Participation)(#attendance-and-participation) for CSC326 penalties.

Attendance to lecture and labs is mandatory!

#### Absences Policy
Excused absences are defined in the NC State Academic Policy on Attendance Regulations (http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03).  **Documentation of the absence is required to excuse an absence.**

  * Exam makeups will only be given with a documented excused absence.
  * Assignment extensions will only be given with a documented excused absence.  If the course has progressed in such a way that an extension cannot be easily accommodated, then an alternative assignment may be given.
  * Waiving of lecture or lab exercises/activities, if appropriate for the exercise/activity, will only be waived with a documented excused absence.
  
All anticipated absences must be presented to the instructor no later than one week before the absence.  All emergency absences must be turned in no later than one week after the student's return date.  All other absences will be unexcused.

Documentation of absences must go to the instructor for approval.  Electronic documentation is preferred.

#### Makeup Work Policy
All makeup work must be completed in the timeframe agreed upon by the instructor and student.
